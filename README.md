# Full Stack Trivia API Final Project

## Introduction

This project is building a web application called Trivia. User can answer trivia questions to see who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. 
Functions of this web application are:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

## Getting started

We started the full stack application for you. It is desiged with some key functional areas as below. We recommend following the instructions in those files in order.

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a Flask and SQLAlchemy server. You will work primarily in app.py to define your endpoints and can reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup.

More details below
[`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
